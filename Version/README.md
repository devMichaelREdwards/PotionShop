This project uses Semantic Versioning to track the progress.
Each patch version and it's patch notes will be tracked in a file in this folder titled with the version number, i.e. 1.0.0.txt is major version 1
Each minor version should get its own folder.
The current Version is in the Version.txt, which will be renamed and put into the correct place on on the next patch release.
Put patch notes both in the file and in the PR description
